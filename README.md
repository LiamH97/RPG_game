## Gameplay

Players choose a hero class without prior knowledge of the enemy type. The encounter dynamically reveals the enemy's vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of the chosen hero class. The game outputs damage dealt, provides information on enemy resistance, and updates the enemy's health.

### Healing Ability

Heroes with the Holy Spec can heal themselves during encounters, giving them increased survivability.

### Polymorphism OOP Concept

Explore the concept of Polymorphism by allowing players to drink a one-time potion. This potion grants the player abilities from another hero class for a single fight. For example, a Melee Spec class can temporarily act as a Holy Spec, adding an extra layer of strategy to your battles.
### Inheritance OOP Concept
Exploring the concept of inheritance from Object Oriented programming, the enemy and hero classes are parent classes and attributes are edited in the child class for each type.
